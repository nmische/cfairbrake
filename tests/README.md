# CFAirbrake Test Suite

This test suite assumes [MXUnit](http://mxunit.org/) is installed and available `/mxunit`.  To run the test suite browse to `http://localhost/cfairbrake/tests/mxunit/index.cfm`. This assumes you have cloned the cfairbrake project such that it is available at `http://localhost/cfairbrake`. If this is not the case adjust accordingly.
